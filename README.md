# Kraken A5/1 Cracking Project

## Aim 
To fully automate the process of finding the kc to crack a5/1 encryption

## Tech stack
- Python
- C/C++

## Steps to obtain rainbow tables (.dlt)
### Items required:
- Two 2 terabyte hard disks to store rainbow tables, and another hard drive which will be used to store the rainbow tables in their raw formate
- A laptop
- Linux system
### Steps to download
1. Go to this website: https://opensource.srlabs.de/projects/a51-decrypt/files
2. Download all the *.torrent files OR download the one *.tgz file
3. Use a BitTorrent client for step 2 OR you can attempt to find the google drive link to download the rainbow tables
4. Step 3 should take quite long
5. Check md5 hash of all *.dlt files in your hard drive with command (md5 *.md5)
6. Match hashes with: https://jenda.hrach.eu/f2/tables.txt
7. If hashes do not match, please re-download that specific file
### Kraken
8. Clone this repository to your local computer (linux or download DragonOS and either dual bootup or use a VM)
9. 
10. 

## Process
I will be using Python to execute all the commands required to find the kc of a bitstream while asking for the relevant inputs along the way.
